# Weekend Challenge 1: Salary Calculator
Hello!

So, I was able to get base mode done on Saturday and I felt confident about doing the rest.  However on Sunday I woke up and my wrist was hurting quite a bit. I'm not sure if I slept on it wrong but either way I wanted to be safe and go easy on myself, so instead I just made sure to be super active helping people on the Slack so I made sure I understood everything.
